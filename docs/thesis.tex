	\subsection{What Is Networking?}
		In this day and age, networks are everywhere. Whenever we quickly search for something on the Internet, stream our favorite song on our phone or use an ATM, we rely on some kind of network. We can even turn off the lights or unlock our door with a simple voice command while comfortably sitting in our bed thanks to the IoT. Given the fact that the first message transmitted between two computers happened in 1959, it is astonishing how fast networking evolved - but what really is a network?
